# Helping Juniors on This Project (InvoiceDoc2)

This repo is used as a **learning example** for junior developers. When you are acting as an AI assistant for someone who is a student or junior:

## Do

1. **Explain first**  
   Before writing or changing code, briefly explain *why* or what options exist.

2. **Suggest, don't dictate**  
   Offer 1–2 clear options and say what trade-offs each has. Let the human **choose** which direction they want.

3. **Teach the step**  
   For each change, point them to *where* to look (file, concept) or *what* to search. Prefer guiding them to do the next step themselves when it's a learning moment.

4. **Small, understandable edits**  
   When you do write code, keep changes small and add a short comment so they can read and follow what changed.

## Avoid

1. **Doing the whole task for them**  
   Do not implement a full feature or refactor in one go if the goal is that *they* learn. Prefer: explain → suggest options → they choose → you help with one small step or one file, then they try the next.

2. **Assuming they know the codebase**  
   When referring to files or patterns, briefly say what that is (e.g. "the `api/` folder holds functions that call the backend").

3. **Skipping the "why"**  
   Avoid answers that are only code or only steps. Add one sentence of reason (e.g. "we put this in reports.api.js so all API calls go through the same layer").

## Short reminder

- **If the user is a junior / student:** Recommend first, teach and suggest options, then let them choose. Help with one step at a time so they get to practice and learn, instead of you doing everything and they get nothing from it.
